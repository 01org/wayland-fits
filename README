DESCRIPTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wayland Functional Integration Test Suite (aka. wayland-fits, wfits)

Wayland-fits is a fully automated functional integration test suite.  It's
main purpose is to test the functionality and integration of client-side
(i.e. toolkit) and server-side (compositor) implementations of the Wayland
protocol.  It includes tests that validate user input events originating from
the server-side or from an emulated system-level device (depends on the type
of backend used).  There are also tests with emphasis on cross-validating client
and server states.

The test framework design includes a wfits test extension that defines two
Wayland protocols. The first protocol is a interface for generating input events
on the server-side (e.g. mouse, keyboard, touch). The second is a interface for
querying state information from the server/compositor.  This extension is
exploited by most of the tests.  Thus, to run these tests on a particular Wayland
server/compositor, there has to be an implementation of this extension for that
compositor (i.e. src/extensions/<compositor>).

A Weston implementation of the wfits test extension (weston-wfits.so) is
included as a pluggable module to Weston.  For the drm and x11 backends, it
employs uinput to emulate various input devices.  For the headless backend, it
uses the weston input API's directly.  It also exposes various other
internal compositor states that can be queried by tests, such as surface
geometry and pointer coordinates.

REQUIREMENTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 * check - A unit testing framework for C >= 0.9.8
 * boost - Boost C++ libraries >= 1.48.0
 * Wayland >= 1.0.6
 * Weston >= 1.0.6

 Optional:
 * EFL/Elementary Wayland >= 1.7.6
 * GTK+ Wayland
 * Cogl/Clutter Wayland
 * Qt Wayland


COMPILING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 $ ./autogen.sh
 $ make
 $ make install

 See http://wayland.freedesktop.org/build.html for more information on general
 Wayland building requirements/options (e.g. installing in a custom location).


RUNNING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 You need to load the wfits test extension into your Wayland compositor (Note:
 an implementation of the wfits test extension is needed for each compositor,
 currently Weston is the only one supported at the moment):

 For Weston, this is weston-wfits.so and it's loaded with the --modules option:

  $ weston --modules=weston-wfits.so &

 Next, run the test suite:

  $ wfits

 You can filter the tests you want to run by using the --filter option.  This
 option takes a boost-regex style expression (POSIX-extended, case-ignored),
 for example:

  $ wfits --filter core.*
  $ wfits --filter .*pointer.*


BUGS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 If a test is failing, try to determine if it's an actual bug in the test or a
 bug in the component that is being tested.  If it's a bug in the test itself,
 file at:

 https://bugs.freedesktop.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Wayland&component=wayland-fits

 Otherwise, file a bug in the appropriate database assigned to the failing
 component if one does not already exist.
