TODO
----

* Keep writing more tests!
 * drag-n-drop
 * cut and paste
 * egl tests in core
 * Qt-Wayland tests
 * Clutter-Wayland tests
 * other integration tests (get creative)

* Write wfits test extensions for other wayland compositors.
 * May need to petition them for module/plugin support.

* Refactor or remove useless/pointless EFL-Wayland tests.
 * At some point, someone was given the task of quantity was better
   than quality.  We should revisit some tests here and determine their
   usefulness. Most of these would be the ones that just invoke/exercise the efl
   API's and don't have any client<->server or input-event related checks.
   Albeit, if anything, they may still be useful to detect crashing or toolkit
   state; but that alone is not necessarily in the nature of what we really want
   to validate/test (which would ultimately be Wayland integration).

* Move away from the "check" dependency.
 * It's important that tests are executed in a forked process.
 * It's important that tests have a timeout.
