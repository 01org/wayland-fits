TODO
----

* keep writing more tests!
 * drag-n-drop
 * cut and paste
 * egl tests in core
 * Qt-Wayland tests
 * Clutter-Wayland tests
 * other integration tests (get creative)

* write wfits test extensions for other wayland compositors
 * may need to petition them for module/plugin support

* refactor or remove useless/pointless EFL-Wayland tests
 * at some point, someone was under the impression that quantity was better
   than quality.  We should revisit some tests here and determine usefulness.

* move away from the "check" dependency
 * note, it's important that tests are executed in a forked process
